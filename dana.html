                    <p class="ftco-animate">
                    I began exploring the physical practice of yoga in my early twenties, moving between home sessions and local classes until I found a studio community that supported and deepened my commitment to the path.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ftco-animate">
                    I completed my 200 hour teacher training at Charm City Yoga in Baltimore, Maryland under the guidance of Kim Manfredi in 2016. In 2018, I earned an additional 300 hours with international yoga teacher Jared McCann at Lighthouse Yoga School in Brooklyn, New York. His teachings profoundly shaped the way I understand, experience, and share this practice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ftco-animate">
                    I have continued my studies with teachers including Rose Erin Vaughn and Yoshio Hama, whose discipline and devotion continue to guide my growth. I have also completed a Rocket Yoga training with Pat McCleaf, further expanding the range, depth, and curiosity within my personal practice and teaching.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ftco-animate">
                    Yoga has become a pathway back to my own inner divinity and a reminder of the divine presence that lives within all beings. Through intentional movement and breath I return to compassion, steadiness, and the awareness that we are connected to something far greater than ourselves.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ftco-animate">
                    Pranayama and meditation are central to my practice. These tools have expanded my awareness, supported deep stillness, and cultivated a sense of calm that I carry into my daily life. They continue to reveal the quiet clarity that arises when the mind, breath, and body move in harmony.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ftco-animate">
                    I teach because I believe yoga is an offering in service to others. When we care for ourselves with conscious movement, intentional breath, and mindful presence, we expand our capacity to care for all beings everywhere.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ftco-animate">
                    It is a privilege to move and breathe in this body, and I hope to share the practice in a way that honors its sacred roots and supports every student who steps onto the mat.
