                        I have been practicing Hatha yoga since my early twenties. I visited studios and gyms from time to time but mainly practiced in my home until I discovered hot yoga and a warm community of yogis in 2013; I was instantly hooked!
                    </p>
                    <p class="ftco-animate">
                        I received my 200 Hour RYT certificate at Charm City Yoga in Baltimore, MD, now Yoga Works, under the guidance of Kim Manfredi in August of 2016. In July of 2018 I received an additional 300 Hour RYT certificate with international yoga teacher, Jared McCann, at Lighthouse Yoga School in Brooklyn, New York.

                        I practice yoga to find stillness and to cultivate loving kindness for myself and for others. Through my practice I draw a deeper connection to the self within my mind and body. My asana and meditation practice have allowed me to be a more patient, understanding and all around better human being.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ftco-animate">
                        I teach yoga because I believe in the power of it. I believe in caring for my mind and my body; carving out time to nourish myself allows me to cultivate compassion and care for others. It is an amazing gift to be able to move in our bodies and to find a connection between that movement and our breath; I donâ€™t ever want to take that for granted.
