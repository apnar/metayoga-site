Being an avid athlete my entire life, I eventually reached a physical dead end.  Knee surgeries, ankle surgeries, years of impact, and common body misalignments left me with chronic knee pain, degenerating cartilage, arthritis, scar tissue, bone fragments and limited mobility.  I could no longer keep up my fitness regimen.  I devastatingly had to quit my life-long love affair with running, and more surgery seemed to be the only (and bleak) option.

That is when I discovered the Bikram method of hot yoga, and my life has been changing ever since.  Yoga had been part of my fitness routine for more than ten years, but it wasn’t until I discovered this basic, repetitive hatha method that I developed a true and devoted practice.  I dedicated myself to the yoga practice and not only did my physical body slowly but surely start healing (without surgery), but through the practice I developed a deeper connection and healing to every part of my being, body, mind and spirit.  Gradually I have introduced a variety of other methods into my practice, but my dedication and quest for knowledge has remained unwavering.

I never dreamed what this practice could do for me.  I love it so much because it allows me to practice/see truth in body, mind, and soul, and to enhance self-love, acceptance, and service to all.  It allows me to feel more present in my life and connect more deeply to everything and everyone in it.

Following my passion for the yoga, in 2017 I received my 200 RYT certification at the Bikram Yoga Rockville studio.  After a year of teaching yoga my desire for more knowledge was burning so I traveled to Lighthouse Yoga School in Brooklyn, NY and received my 300 RYT from International yoga teacher Jared McCann.  Since then I have been able to continue learning online from Jared and other former Lighthouse teachers Rose Erin Vaughan, and Yoshio Hama. I try to continue my education whenever I can through in person and online workshops and classes.  My main methods of practice/teaching practice are currently Bikram, Ashtanga, Dharma and Rocket.

Holding a Bachelors in Fine Arts and a Master’s degree in teaching, I am a former public high school art teacher and track and field coach.  I took time away from my career to raise our son, and now it has been exciting to return to my teaching occupation in a completely new way.  It has been a great fit to combine my teaching experience with my love for physical and spiritual health to help serve through sharing the vast benefits of this amazing life practice.
