                    It is totally normal to feel a little nervous or intimated before your first class. Our beginners class and our 26 & 2 class are designed for new yogis. Many students who come to yoga have never practiced yoga before. Don’t worry, just show up and breathe!

                    Yoga asana is designed for anyone! If you are not flexible or out of shape, those are some of the best reasons to begin your yoga journey.

                    <h3 class="subheading">WHAT DO I WEAR?</h3>
                    We recommend light clothing and fabrics that can withstand sweat and are comfortable to move in. We suggest trying to avoid any clothing with ties or knots, as it may be uncomfortable pressing into the mat and/or twisting.

                    <h3 class="subheading">WHAT DO I NEED TO BRING?</h3>
                    We suggest to arrive at the studio about 20 minutes before your first class. Bring a mat, towel and water. If you don’t have those items, you can rent/purchase them at the studio. It is preferable to come on an empty stomach and well hydrated.

                    <h3 class="subheading">WHY THE HEAT?</h3>
                    Many of our yoga classes are practiced in a heated room but don't let that intimidate you. You are changing the construction of your body as you perform these postures. The heat makes your body more malleable. Warm muscles are more elastic and less susceptible to injury. The heat also helps to increase the flexibility of the body so you can stretch safely into different postures. It also increases circulation and helps the body release toxins from the organs, muscles and tissues. The heat is meant to be therapeutic and will leave you feeling rejuvenated.

                    <h3 class="subheading">IS IT NORMAL TO FEEL DIZZY, NAUSEOUS, OR LIGHTHEADED IN CLASS?</h3>
                    In your first few classes it is normal to feel a little dizzy or nauseous at some point in class. If you feel these sensations don’t try to push through them, just take it easy and rest as you need to. Remember to breathe through your nose, listen to your body and take care of yourself during class. In just a few classes your body will begin to acclimate to the heat, detox and these sensations will eventually disappear. A headache is a symptom of dehydration. Being well hydrated before class will help you feel better during class.

                    <h3 class="subheading">CAN I LOSE WEIGHT?</h3>
                    Yes! Yoga asana is a great way to burn calories, tone muscles and boost your metabolism. You can burn between 350-600 calories in a class. Consistency is key; the more you come the more results you will see. As you develop a regular practice you will notice that often your cravings for sugar and caffeine decrease and as you feel better you will naturally start to make better food choices.

                    <h3 class="subheading">HOW OFTEN SHOULD I PRACTICE?</h3>
                    Come as much as you can! Yoga is cumulative, the more you come, the better you will feel. We recommend daily practice for one or two months for a new you. Regular practitioners average 3-5 times a week.

                    Yes, we do! Private yoga sessions are beneficial for all students at any stage of their practice. Through private lessons, students receive customized teaching and modifications that will work to deepen their connection to their practice and to the self.

                    Then this may be the perfect exercise for you! Yoga can provide you with a cardiovascular workout and can build strength and flexibility without the harmful impact and potential misalignment of many other exercises. With a consistent practice the yoga can help heal old injuries and break down scar tissue.
